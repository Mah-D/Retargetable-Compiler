B. Software

   Red Hat, Fedora, SuSE Linux, openSUSE, Ubuntu, or Debian with kernel
   2.6.15 or later. RHEL4 with kernel 2.6.9 is also supported.

   On ARM, Angstrom and Debian are supported.

   To install on other distributions, refer to "Install/Manual Override
   or "Install/BusyBox".


C. C/C++ Runtime
   Zoom and the Zoom installer require glibc-2.4 (libstdc.so.6) or 
   later.

   For PowerPC platforms, libstdc++.so.5 is required.

   * openSUSE / SuSE Linux Enterprise
   On OpenSUSE 11.1
   a. Open YaST.
   b. Open "Software" and "Software Management".
   c. Click "Available" to select uninstalled packages.
   d. Search for "libstdc++".
   e. Right-click on "libstdc++33" and select "Install".
   f. Click "Apply".

D. Kernel Headers

   Compiling kernel modules requires the Linux kernel headers.

   * Fedora / Red Hat Enterprise Linux
   On Fedora 10 (i386) with default kernel:
   a. Install the kernel-devel package. 
      $ yum install kernel-devel
   On Fedora 10 (i386) with PAE kernel:
   a. Install the kernel-PAE package.
      $ yum install kernel-PAE-devel

   * openSUSE / SuSE Linux Enterprise
   On openSUSE 11.1 (x86-64):
   a. Open YaST.
   b. Open "Software" and "Software Management".
   c. Click "Available" to select uninstalled packages.
   d. Search for "kernel-source".
   e. Right-click on "kernel-source" and select "Install".
   f. Click "Apply".

   * Ubuntu
   On Ubuntu 8.10 (x86-64):
   a. Find kernel release.
      $ uname -r
      2.6.27-7-generic
   b. Install the package with apt-get.
      $ apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.27-7-generic

E. Debug Information

   To correlate source code to samples, Zoom requires code to be
   compiled with DWARF debug information. For most compilers, pass in
   the "-g" flag to generate this information.

   GCC and other compilers for C, C++ and Fortran code generate DWARF
   information that has been tested with Zoom.

   Zoom supports the "debuginfo" packages found in Red Hat and SUSE
   distributions and the "dbg" and "dbgsym" packages found in Ubuntu
   and Debian distributions.

   For information on installing debug information packages:

   * Fedora / Red Hat Enterprise Linux
   - Read "What are debuginfo rpms, and how do I get them?" at
     http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/StackTraces.
   - The source code is in the "debuginfo" packages.

   * openSUSE / SuSE Linux Enterprise
   - Read "Debuginfo Packages" at 
     http://en.opensuse.org/Crashdump_Debugging
   - The source code is in separate "debugsource" packages.

   * Ubuntu
   - Read https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash.
   - Use "apt-get source <package>" to download the source code.


========================================================================
2. Install
========================================================================
A. GUI

   To launch the graphical user interface (GUI) installer, 

   $ ./install.sh

B. Command-Line

   If the installer does not fallback to the text-based installer:
   $ ./install.sh --text

   Please report any errors you see in the terminal and send the file
   "/var/log/Zoom-install.log" to support@rotateright.com.

C. Manual Override

   Please follow the steps below if you are unable to use the GUI or
   command-line installers.

   a. Become root user in a bash shell for all operations.
      $ sudo /bin/bash

   b. Unpack the Zoom archive.
      # tar -xvzf <archive>.tar.gz
      # cd <archive>
      # tar -xvf .install.tar
      # cd .install

   c. Setup Zoom.
      # ./setup.sh extract

   d. Compile and install the rrprofile and rrnotify kernel modules.
      # tar -xvf kmod/rrprofile.tar
      # pushd rrprofile
      # make
      # ./install.sh
      # popd
      # tar -xvf kmod/rrnotify.tar
      # pushd rrnotify
      # make
      # ./install.sh
      # popd

      You may need to edit the Makefile, the install.sh script, and the
      kernel module scripts (common/rrprofile-generic and
      common/rrnotify-generic) for your Linux distribution.

   e. Install the script for the oprofile kernel module.

      If the RotateRight kernel modules do not compile (step 'd.') or
      support your hardware, install the oprofile script:
      # tar -xvf kmod/oprofile.tar
      # pushd oprofile
      # ./install.sh
      # popd

      Do not install the oprofile script if the RotateRight kernel 
      modules compiled correctly (step 'd.').

D. BusyBox

   Please follow the steps below to install ZoomCLI on a system with 
   the BusyBox environment. 

   Pre-requisites:
   * You must be the root user on the target (BusyBox) system. 
   * Install the bash shell on the target system.

   a. Ensure that the target system has oprofile support compiled in. 
      # cat /proc/filesystems | grep oprofilefs
      nodev	oprofilefs

   b. Unpack and setup Zoom on the target system.
      # tar -xvzf <archive>.tar.gz
      # ./install.sh

E. License File Path

   The default license path is ${HOME}/.zoom/license/zoom_license.txt. 
   Set the ZOOM_LICENSE_FILE_PATH environment variable to specify a
   custom location for your license file:

   $ export ZOOM_LICENSE_FILE_PATH=${HOME}/zoom_license.txt
   $ Zoom

F. Limiting Memory Usage

   The Zoom UI utilizes a Java virtual machine. By default the Zoom UI
   scales the maximum heap memory the JVM can use based on the total
   system memory. Set the ZOOM_MAX_JAVA_HEAP_MB environment variable to
   specify a custom limit:

   $ export ZOOM_MAX_JAVA_HEAP_MB=4096
   $ Zoom

========================================================================
3. Usage
========================================================================
To launch the GUI Zoom profiler, click its application icon or type
'Zoom' on a terminal command-line:

  $ Zoom

To launch the command-line interface (CLI) zoom profiler, type 'zoom'
on a terminal command-line:

  $ zoom

After profiling, a "profile_*.zoom" file will be written to the current
working directory. This file is an archival representation of the
profile which can be opened by the Zoom GUI application.


========================================================================
4. Uninstall
========================================================================
A. GUI

   To launch the GUI uninstaller, type the following on a terminal
   command-line:

   $ sudo /opt/rotateright/uninstallZoom.sh

B. Command-Line

   Please use the command below if the uninstaller does not fallback to
   the text-based installer:

   $ sudo /opt/rotateright/uninstallZoom.sh --text

C. Manual Override

   To manually uninstall Zoom:

   a. Become root user in a bash shell for all operations.
      $ sudo /bin/bash

   b. Unpack the Zoom archive and export the current directory.
      # tar -xvzf <archive>.tar.gz
      # tar -xvf .install.tar
      # cd <archive>/.install

   c. Remove Zoom.
      # ./setup.sh remove

   d. Uninstall the kernel modules.
      # ./kmod/uninstall_driver.sh rrprofile
      # ./kmod/uninstall_driver.sh rrnotify
      # ./kmod/uninstall_driver.sh oprofile


========================================================================
5. Maintenance
========================================================================
A. Kernel Updates

   In the event of a kernel upgrade, you will need to recompile
   RotateRight's custom kernel modules:

   $ sudo /opt/rotateright/Zoom/setup/install_driver.sh

   The installer compiles and installs RotateRight's custom kernel
   modules. If the installer fails to compile the kernel modules, it
   will use the oprofile kernel module instead.

   Follow the steps in the next section only if the compilation does
   not succeed.

B. Zoom Kernel Modules

   a. Ensure that the correct kernel headers are installed.
      * Fedora / Red Hat Enterprise Linux
      kernel-devel or kernel-PAE-devel must be installed for the running
      kernel.
      For example, on Fedora 10 (x86-64) with default kernel:
      $ uname -r
      2.6.27.5-117.fc10.x86_64
      $ rpm -q kernel-devel
      kernel-devel-2.6.27.5-117.fc10.x86_64

      * openSUSE / SuSE Linux Enterprise
      kernel-source must be installed for the running kernel.
      For example, on openSUSE 11.1 (x86-64):
      $ uname -r
      2.6.27.7-9-default
      $ rpm -q kernel-source
      kernel-source-2.6.27.7-9.1

      * Ubuntu / Debian
      linux-headers must be installed for the running kernel.
      For example, on Ubuntu 8.10 (x86-64):
      $ uname -r
      2.6.27-7-generic
      $ dpkg-query --show --showformat='${Package}\t${Status}\n' \
            linux-headers-2.6.27-7-generic
      linux-headers-2.6.27-7-generic	install ok installed

   b. Untar both rrprofile.tar and rrnotify.tar. Go to their respective
      subdirectories, build with 'make', and run 'install.sh':
      $ tar -xvf /opt/rotateright/Zoom/setup/kmod/<kmodname.tar>
      $ cd <kmodname>
      $ make
      $ sudo ./install.sh

      If needed, you can remove the kernel module by executing
      uninstall.sh.
      $ sudo ./uninstall.sh

   c. Uninstall the oprofile kernel module if you successfully built
      both rrprofile and rrnotify.
      $ tar -xvf kmod/oprofile.tar
      $ cd oprofile
      $ sudo ./uninstall.sh


========================================================================
6. Limitations
========================================================================
A. Security

   Zoom uses setuid because Zoom is a system-wide profiler that may
   require access to system-owned files.

B. Virtualization

   Under a virtual machine, Zoom will profile with the "OS Timer"
   trigger. Hardware counters are not available because they are not
   virtualized.

C. Frame Pointers

   Assume function A calls function B which in turn calls library L
   (A -> B -> L). If library L omits frame pointers, Zoom will show that
   A called L because the stack frame pointer and return address are not
   updated inside library L.

   If the library L is compiled with "-fno-omit-frame-pointer", the
   frame pointer and return address will be correctly updated.

D. Zoom i386 (32-bit) on Linux x86-64 (64-bit)

   It is not possible to run Zoom i386 (32-bit) on Linux x86-64 
   (64-bit).

E. libvirt Virtualization Toolkit

   Zoom remote networking is incompatible with the libvirt toolkit. 
   Disable the libvirtd daemon before using Zoom. 

F. Zoom on Angstrom 

   The Zoom installer requires that bash be installed:

   $ opkg install bash

   Also, Zoom requires libsegfault:

   $ opkg install libsegfault 

G. Crash with openSUSE 10.3

   On a fresh openSUSE 10.3 install, bug-buddy must be removed or
   updated.

   To remove:
   $ sudo zypper rm bug-buddy

   To update, enable online updating with YaST and type:
   $ sudo zypper install bug-buddy

   Reference:
   - https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=331618

H. GLib Warnings with Ubuntu 9.10, Fedora 12 and Debian Squeeze

   This is a known issue and should not affect Zoom.
