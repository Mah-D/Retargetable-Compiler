The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by RotateRight that replace and/or supplement the original software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.

A.  You may use Zoom to: (i) test or monitor system and application software; and (ii) develop system and application software. You may make only as many internal use copies of Zoom as reasonably necessary to use Zoom as permitted under this License and distribute such copies only to your employees whose job duties require them to so use Zoom; provided that you reproduce on each copy of Zoom or portion thereof, all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.
