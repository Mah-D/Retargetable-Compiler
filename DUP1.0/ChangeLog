Sun Oct 10 11:17:25 CEST 2010
	Fixed segv in dup due to "concurrent modification"
	of iterated vector in the presence of a self-loop.
	Thanks to Riyaz for reporting! -CG

Sat Jul 17 21:44:49 CEST 2010
	Extended faninany with "S" mode for processing of
	blocks of embedded size. -CG

Fri Jul 16 16:58:21 CEST 2010
	Adding router filter. -CG

Tue Jun  8 22:43:47 CEST 2010
	DUP testcases pass again.  Error reporting is still
	not nice, but SSH authentication should now work.
	Relleasing DUP 0.1.0. -CG

Mon Jun  7 12:19:48 CEST 2010
	Moved applications out of main build (new configure.ac
	is now in src/applications/).  Started work on
	implementing DUP Protocol v2. -CG

Fri Jan  8 18:49:07 CET 2010
	Improving IPv6 support for some systems. -CG
	Adding nodelay filter. -CG

Fri Nov 27 12:20:50 CET 2009
	Releasing DUP 0.0.1. -CG

Fri Nov 20 13:07:21 CET 2009
	Changed filters (fanout, faninany, deal, holmerge)
	to tolerate open file descriptors of the wrong type
	(i.e., write-only file descriptors, other than stdout/stderr
	for faninany).  Code now checks if the file-descriptor
	supports the respective operation and ignores it if not. -CG

Fri Nov 20 12:13:21 CET 2009
	Added buffer-dup filter, a faster replacement for
	the traditional 'buffer' command and (on some systems)
	slow versions of 'cat'.  Unlike traditional 'buffer',
	buffer-dup also supports "unbounded" (growing)
	buffers, only limited by the size of available
	virtual memory. -CG

Wed Nov 18 18:26:21 CET 2009
	Eliminated a memmove from the filter code to
	improve performance. -CG

Mon Oct 12 15:17:57 CEST 2009
	Added support for writing a PID file to dupd.
	Fixed problems with logging to file, daemonization
	and relative paths. -CG

Mon Oct 12 14:24:20 CEST 2009
	Making sure timeouts correspond to specification
	(Mantis #8). -CG

Mon Oct 12 14:03:18 CEST 2009
	Fixing Mantis #11 (dupd shoud check for
	control-connection being closed while
	waiting for data connections in order to
	shutdown session as soon as possible
	on error). -CG

Fri Oct  9 10:28:26 CEST 2009
	Fixed missing check for duplicate labedls
	(Mantis #28). -CG

Wed Oct  7 10:18:52 CEST 2009
	Fixed bug in process-readiness check (used
	wrong, uninitialized variable). -CG

Tue Oct  6 16:34:14 CEST 2009
	Increased the number of file descriptors to
	65536 on GNU/Linux (overriding FD_SETSIZE).
	Reduced buffer size in dupd for non-control
	connections (to avoid wasting memory). -CG

Tue Oct  6 14:26:11 CEST 2009
	Added check to make sure that we don't use
	sockets larger than FD_SETSIZE (which would
	cause memory corruption in conjunction with
	our select calls). -CG

Tue Oct  6 12:27:53 CEST 2009
	Fixed various performance issues in dup to dupd
	communication.  Eliminated call to fcntl for each
	socket in the select set (expensive check for
	debugging only).  Fixed reporting of errors from
	dupd to dup (messages now printed).  Added
	caching of DNS lookups to dupd. -CG

Tue Feb 10 12:36:45 MST 2009
	Added filter "eat". -CG

Sun Jan 25 12:40:44 MST 2009
	Adding daemonization for dupd and various
	other command-line options for dup and dupd. -CG

Sat Jan 24 00:45:11 MST 2009
	Basic DUP functionality working (control
	stream, data streams between dup and dupd
	and data streams between dupds as well as
	loopback). -CG

Thu Jan  8 02:17:10 MST 2009
	Finished first draft of the dup code (at this
	point entirely untested, need dupd first). -CG

Tue Jan  6 20:38:11 MST 2009
	Fixed various memory leaks, uninitialized
	variables and some style issues. -CG

Wed Dec 10 23:38:43 MST 2008
	Renamed fanin to gather (which is the more
	appropriate CMS name for what we are doing).
	Eliminate most memmove calls for processing
	of lines. -CG
	Added DUP parser based on Flex and Bison. -KG

Wed Dec  3 23:36:11 MST 2008
	Added FD 3 processing functionality to deal. -CG

Mon Dec  1 23:31:57 MST 2008
	Renamed cp to cmd and rrout to deal. -CG

Mon Dec  1 23:18:37 MST 2008
	Added duplicate. -CG

Mon Dec  1 20:18:55 MST 2008
	Renamed rrmerge to fanin. -CG

Mon Dec  1 19:56:04 MST 2008
	Added cp. -CG

Mon Dec  1 15:10:58 MST 2008
	Added gate. -CG

Fri Nov 21 13:29:15 MST 2008
	Added holmerge and rrout. -CG

Fri Nov 21 01:36:24 MST 2008
	Added rrmerge (previously known as merge). -CG

Fri Nov 21 00:33:43 MST 2008
	Added lookup. -CG

Thu Nov 20 21:02:53 MST 2008
	Added mgrep (previously known as CMS LOCATE, but the
	locate name would conflict with a well-known UNIX
	tool). -CG

Thu Nov 20 17:54:03 MST 2008
	Added delay. -CG

Thu Nov 20 00:05:09 MST 2008
	Added fanout with testcases. -CG

Tue Nov 18 22:58:51 MST 2008
	Project started (build system added). -CG
