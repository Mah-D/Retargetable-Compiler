                         The DUP System


What is the DUP System?
=======================

The DUP System is a language system for parallel and distributed
stream processing.  A key difference to most other stream processing
languages is that the DUP System is largely language-agnostic: the
actual compuations can be implemented in almost any programming
language (including a combination of many languages).  DUP is only
responsible for organizing the parallel and distributed execution.

As a language system DUP includes primarily an interpreter (the "dup"
command), a run-time system (the "dupd" command) and a run-time
library (many small command-line tools that can be used from within
DUP applications or theoretically also stand-alone).


Dependencies:
=============

* POSIX-compatible operating system (BSD, Linux, Solaris OS X, etc.)
* C++ compiler
* (Open)SSH (for distributed execution only)


How to install?
===============

Simple "configure; make; make install" process.  Note that the DUP
system must be installed on all participating machines.


Usage
=====

First, create an SSH public-private key pair for authentication and
run an ssh-agent that allows password-less (!) login to all
participating systems.  If the DUP application only runs on the local
machine, this is not required.

Then, create a "Hello world" DUP application:

$ echo 'hw@localhost[1|DUP:1] $ echo Hello World;' > hello.dup
$ dup -c hello.dup

paper.
