DONE:
export _CXX_CXXSUFFIX=cc to solve the *.cc file extension error
htons problem
      make sure that dup_network.h is included first in each file
      where it is included
      -add #include <arpa.h> to dup_network.h
      -#include <dup_network.h> in dup_string.h
      -add #define OS360 1
      #define _OPEN_THREADS 3
      -copied z/OS specific includes from libmicrohttpd's platform.h
      into dup_network.h
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <unistd.h>
      #include <sys/resource.h>
      #include <string.h> in strn_functs
      ensure there are no C++ comments incode from C code
in control connection.h change static const to define 

TODO-Jeff:
gnu-getopt should be made available.  Include the source files
in the distribution as they do not exist on z/OS.

getopt for dupd

figure out why we have macro yywrap in dup_lex.c that takes one argument
but also a funtion yywrap that takes zero arguments

dup_process::start
	-start needs to return a return value

dupd
write_dup_stream::run
	-needs a return value even after an abort

take out W and WError from the build system.

check filters for c++ comments 


TODO-Christian:
io_descriptor.o
	vsnprintf not found


HELP-IBM:!
/usr/include/cstdio 
	-text unsigned is unexpected error
	-make connection.o
dup_string.h
	-first operand to new operator must be size_t
dup_lex 
	-duplicate type sepcifier int and unsigned in sys/types.h
operator new problem for 
	 -dupd/file_descriptor.h


????:
process.o has lots of template errors.
