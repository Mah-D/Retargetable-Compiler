.TH CMD "1" "Dec 1 2008" "cmd"

.SH "NAME"
cmd \- execute commands read from stdin

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B cmd
[\fICOMMAND (ARGS)*]\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
cmd first executes the specified command on the command line (if any) and
then starts reading commands from stdin.  Each command is executed and
the output is written to stdout.  Error messages from the command are
passed to stderr.  Commands are executed regardless of the streams
connected to cmd.
.PP
If FD 3 is connected, cmd will write the return code of each program to
FD 3.  Each line contains three integers.   The first is the return code,
the second the signal (if the command was killed by a signal; otherwise 0)
and the last a flag set to 1 to indicate thate the program was aborted
or core dumped (otherwise the flags is 0).
.PP
If cmd is started with more than the first four file descriptors, commands
started through cmd can write to those file descriptors.
.PP
Commands are executed sequentially.  cmd will wait for each child process
to terminate before starting the next one.  If cmd fails to run a particular
command, an error message explaining the cause will be printed to stderr
and the process will terminate with status code 1.
.PP
cmd is inspired by the CMS CP stage; however the name cp was already taken...
