are not dropped are sent to file descriptor 1 (stdout).

drop is similar to head(1) or tail(1), except that it combines both
utilities, allows you to drop from the head and the tail of a stream,
and it outputs dropped lines and records to stderr.
.TP
FIRST 
indicates how many lines or records to drop from the beginning
of the data stream read on stdin. By default, FIRST is 1.
.TP
LAST 
indicates  how many lines or records to drop from the end
of the data stream read on stdin. By default, LAST is 0.
.TP
RECORDSIZE 
indicates the size of the records to be processed. A
record size of 0 indicates that records are distinguished by '\n'.
By default, RECORDSIZE is 0.
.PP
Note that if only one argument is given, drop assumes it is the
FIRST argument. If two arguments are given, drop assumes they are
the FIRST and LAST arguments.
